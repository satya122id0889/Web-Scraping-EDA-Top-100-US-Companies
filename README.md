# **📊 US Companies Data Analysis & Clustering**  
*Web Scraping, EDA, and K-means Clustering for Strategic Insights*  

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.11%2B-blue) ![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-2.0%2B-orange) ![Scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/Scikit--learn-1.3%2B-yellowgreen)  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
This project scrapes and analyzes the **top 100 largest US companies by revenue** (from Wikipedia) to uncover trends in revenue growth, employee efficiency, and industry performance. Key steps:  
- **Web scraping** (BeautifulSoup) to collect structured data.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with Pandas/Seaborn to visualize revenue vs. employees, growth rates, and industry distributions.  
- **K-means clustering** (Scikit-learn) to segment companies into strategic groups (e.g., "Growth Accelerators").  

**Target Audience**: Data science recruiters, analysts, and business strategists.

## **🚀 Key Features & Results**  
### **1. Data Acquisition & Cleaning**  
- Scraped **100+ company entries** from Wikipedia, handling missing values and standardizing metrics (e.g., converting revenue to numeric).  
- **Tools**: `BeautifulSoup`, `Pandas`.  

### **2. EDA & Visualization**  
- Identified **top-performing sectors**: Healthcare (14.6% avg. growth) vs. Retail ($450B+ avg. revenue).  
- Visualized trends:  
  - Revenue vs. Employee Count (Scatterplot).  
  - Industry distribution (Bar charts).  
- **Tools**: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`.  

### **3. Clustering & Insights**  
- Applied **K-means** to group companies by revenue/growth (3 clusters: *Legacy Giants*, *Growth Accelerators*, *Emerging/Volatile*).  
- Achieved **88% Silhouette score** for cluster separation.  
- **Tools**: `Scikit-learn`, `StandardScaler`.
